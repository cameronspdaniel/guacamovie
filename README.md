Project Proposal:

An interactive site predicting movie success based on prior movie data


TEAM: Cameron Daniel (lead), Dustin Markan, Eric Song, Prabhdeep Kaur, Bhavan Bagri

Topic: A website that will, though graphical analysis, visually examine comparisons and create correlations of several important categories related to the movie industry(i.e. genre, gender lead, production company location, and budget against revenue and user/critic ratings). Displaying this filterable data will help determine the factors that successful movies have in commmon, and thus allow us to predict the performance of future movies in the box office. We measure "success" as high revenue or movie ratings.
