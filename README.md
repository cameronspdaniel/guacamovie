Project Proposal:

An interactive site predicting movie success based on prior movie data


TEAM: Cameron Daniel (lead), Dustin Markan, Eric Song, Prabhdeep Kaur, Bhavan Bagri

Topic: Through graphical analysis, our website visually examines comparisons and presents correlations between several important movie data categories and various "success factors"(i.e. genre, gender lead, production company location, and budget against revenue and user/critic ratings). Displaying this filterable data will help determine the factors that go into a successful movie, and thus allow us to predict the performance of future movies in the box office. We measure "success" as high revenue or movie ratings.
